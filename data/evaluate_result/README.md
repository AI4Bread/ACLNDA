# ACLNDA Model Evaluation Results

This folder contains the prediction results of recall and precision values for LDA (LncRNA-Disease Associations) using the ACLNDA (Asymmetric Graph Contrastive Learning for ncRNA-Disease Associations) model.

## Contents

- **Recall Values**: The recall values indicate the proportion of true positive LDA predictions that were correctly identified by the model.
- **Precision Values**: The precision values represent the proportion of positive LDA predictions made by the model that were actually correct.

## Usage

These files provide detailed evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the ACLNDA model on the LDA task. The results are organized to allow for comprehensive analysis and comparison with other models or experiments.

## Additional Information

For more detailed information on the ACLNDA model and its implementation, please refer to the main project repository [here](#). This folder serves as a supplementary resource for researchers interested in the recall and precision performance of the model.
